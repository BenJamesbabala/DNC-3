This my attempt at recreating and understanding recent DeepMind's creation: Differentiable Neural Computer.

The accompanying paper is published in Nature under the name [Hybrid computing using a neural network with dynamic external memory](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v538/n7626/pdf/nature20101.pdf).

The implementation is recreated in Tensorflow 1.1 and Python 3.6.
